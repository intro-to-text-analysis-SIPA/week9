# Week 9: Data collection: Connecting to the Twitter API with twarc2 + connecting to other social media platform
This week, we will learn how to make data requests from the Twitter API using twarc2, a command line tool and Python library for archiving Twitter data and we will use the Pandas library to wrangle, clean, analyze, and visualize Twitter data. We will also discuss approaches for collecting other types of social media data, including TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, Reddit, and more. 

- Topics covered:
    - How to connect to the Twitter API using twarc2, a Python package developed by [Document the Now](http://www.docnow.io).
    - Ethics of working with Twitter data.
    - How to extract top hashtags.
    - How to get data from Facebook, Instagram, Youtube, TikTok, Reddit, Spotify, and more.

    - Melanie Walsh, _Introduction to Cultural Analytics_, [Twitter Data](https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/04-Data-Collection/10-Twitter.html) (Twitter API setup, Data collection & Analysis, Data Sharing)
- Assignments (due by 10am on the day of class):
    - Work through the curriculum for the upcoming week's session in a Jupyter Notebook. Download your Jupyter Notebook as "ipynb" file (Go to "File", "Download as", "Notebook (.ipynb)"), and [upload](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/adding-a-file-to-a-repository) the file to the weekly GitHub assignment link.
        -  You are welcome to use the dataset provided in the curriculum link or use a dataset of your choice.
